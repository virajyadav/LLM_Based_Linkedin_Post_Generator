Today, he\u2019s a machine learning engineer at Apple.\n\nIzam Mohammed, on the other hand, never went to college. After his 12th, he had two full-time ML engineer job offers mainly due to his open-source contribution.\n\nI\u2019ve met many individuals without computer science degrees or formal education in AI who\u2019ve broken into top tech companies, securing promising roles in AI.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of computer science graduates, relying on traditional approaches, are still struggling to land even an interview call.\n\nThe clear difference between the two groups is - Online credibility.",

        "text": "One thing we have learned at AtliQ Technologies from countless sales calls is this: Sales isn\u2019t about pushing what you want to sell\u2014it\u2019s about understanding what your customer truly needs.\n\nI might want to sell a pen, but if the customer needs a notebook, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll focus on first.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve met the customer\u2019s immediate need (the notebook), you\u2019ve built trust. At that point, introducing the pen becomes natural because you\u2019re no longer just selling\u2014you\u2019re adding value to their experience.\n\nThis principle aligns perfectly with how tools like Gong help sales teams. By analyzing conversations and identifying what the customer truly cares about, you can create value-driven interactions that feel personalized and genuine.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how AI can amplify your sales strategy, attend this no-cost online webinar on January 16 (Thursday) that covers:",
