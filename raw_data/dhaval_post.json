Today, he’s a machine learning engineer at Apple.\n\nIzam Mohammed, on the other hand, never went to college. After his 12th, he had two full-time ML engineer job offers mainly due to his open-source contribution.\n\nI’ve met many individuals without computer science degrees or formal education in AI who’ve broken into top tech companies, securing promising roles in AI.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of computer science graduates, relying on traditional approaches, are still struggling to land even an interview call.\n\nThe clear difference between the two groups is - Online credibility.",

     "text": "One thing we have learned at AtliQ Technologies from countless sales calls is this: Sales isn’t about pushing what you want to sell—it’s about understanding what your customer truly needs.\n\nI might want to sell a pen, but if the customer needs a notebook, that’s what I’ll focus on first.\n\nOnce you’ve met the customer’s immediate need (the notebook), you’ve built trust. At that point, introducing the pen becomes natural because you’re no longer just selling—you’re adding value to their experience.\n\nThis principle aligns perfectly with how tools like Gong help sales teams. By analyzing conversations and identifying what the customer truly cares about, you can create value-driven interactions that feel personalized and genuine.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how AI can amplify your sales strategy, attend this no-cost online webinar on January 16 (Thursday) that covers:",
